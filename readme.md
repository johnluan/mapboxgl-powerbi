# How To
## Setup dev environment
- warning: YMMV, a bit of a trial and error atm, we have some version dependancies nightmare going on
- quirks:
  - looking at `package.json`, we need to compile some codes in nodejs `v1.5.0`, e.g. <br />
    - `src/build/turf.js`, see `package.json` -> `turf-build` (run this  with `npm run turf-build`)
    - browserify also needs to be installed via node v1.5.0 somehow
  - but from information gathered, we need pbiviz `2.6.0` that runs on nodejs `v6.0.0`, weird <br />
    so we need to run the `pbiviz package` in pbiviz `2.6.0`
- to start, best to install `nvm` (node version manager, so we can switch between node versions): <br/>
  `brew update && brew install nvm`
- install node and packages: <br />
  - node `v1.5.0` (`iojs-v1.5.0`)
    - installs node `v1.5.0` - `nvm install iojs-v1.5.0`<br />
    - switch to `v1.5.0` - `nvm use v1.5.0` <br />
    - installs browserify (doesnt work with node v6.0.0) - `npm install -g browserify`<br />
  - node `v6.0.0`
    - installs node `v6.0.0` - `nvm install v6.0.0`<br />
    - switch to `v6.0.0` - `nvm use v6.0.0`, <br />
    - to complete the local package installs - `npm install`
    - install pbiviz `2.6.0` - `npm i -g powerbi-visuals-tools@2.6.0`
- now we should be set, for dev and package follow the steps: 
  - from my understanding, any js code change that needs recompile, will need to be compiled with nodejs `v1.5.0`
  - also some hacky steps, please see [Hacky stuff to make things work](hack.md)
  - then anything to with powerbi e.g. packaging will need to be run on nodejs `v6.0.0`
- you can explore the various commands available in `package.json` -> `scripts` <br />
  to run them would be `npm run xxx`, e.g `npm run turf-build`

# Mapbox Visual for Microsoft Power BI

Make sense of your big & dynamic location data with the Mapbox Visual for Power BI.  Quickly design high-performance map visuals using graduated circles, clusters, and interactive heatmaps.  Even customize your Mapbox visual with custom shapes, imagery, and design using [Mapbox Studio](www.mapbox.com/studio).  Check out the [Mapbox Gallery](https://www.mapbox.com/gallery/) to get a sense of what's possible with Studio.

Drop in the Mapbox Visual to your Power BI dashboard from the [Microsoft Office Store](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/WA104381472?tab=Overview).

### FAQ

#### Supported Power BI Environments and Tools
The Mapbox Visual for Power BI supports:

| Mapbox Visual  Version | PBI Report Server | PBI Mobile (iOS/Android) | PBI Embedded | PBI Publish to Web | PBI Desktop | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Edge | IE11 |
|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------|--------|---------|--------|------|------|
| v 1.2.4                | Yes             | Yes  | Yes          | Yes                | Yes         | Yes    | Yes     | Yes    | Yes  | No  |


#### Firewall rules - Domain names and ports to use with Power BI in a secure environment

The Mapbox Visual by default operates using API resources hosted on `api.mapbox.com` securely requested using HTTPS and your Mapbox access token.  If you need all requests to be made inside of your corporate or air-gapped network, you can host [Mapbox Atlas](https://www.mapbox.com/atlas/) on your own server and run the Mapbox Visual for Power BI completely on-premise.

**No data** in the Power BI data model is ever sent to Mapbox APIs.  Only the requested reference resources including map style sheets, vector tiles, icons, and fonts are retrieved from Mapbox APIs.

| Domain          | Port | Resource                        |
|--------------------|------|-----------------------------|
| api.mapbox.com     | 443  | icons, map styles, fonts |
| *.tiles.mapbox.com | 443  | vector tiles                |

#### How many data points does the Mapbox Visual support?

Mapbox supports up to the maximum allowed by Power BI, 30,000 rows, for all visualization types including Choropleth (fill), cluster, heatmap, and circle.  If your data is >30k rows, the Mapbox Visual will sample your data down to 30k rows and visualize the resultant sample.  If you need to visualize more than 30k rows for your use case, reach out to our sales team to connect you with a Mapbox Partner to setup a custom solution for your use case.
